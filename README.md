# Term_3_Godot_VideoGame

## Documentation

### Purpose

The purpose that I have chosen for my Godot programme for Term 3 is to develop and interpret basic physic principles upon my end-users. My game programme will use a multitude of puzzles and/or combat/exploration to engage my user with moderate problems for my end-ser to solve. This will furthermore develop a sense of quick problem solving for my end-user to enchance their cognitive ability in such moderate/complex situations.

### Audience

The target audience for my game will be those oterh the age of 12. These students will at-least have the ability to comprehend a mediocre amount of difficulty of understanding physics concepts. Although my puzzles intend to be simplisitc and minimalisitc, the outcomes to overcome obstacles will need a comprehensive mind in order to succeed in my game. This is why it is required for much older users to play my game for their ability to understand the complex difficulty is required.
